A lot of parents find swim meets boring — you sit for hours for a few minutes of actual racing — but he absolutely loved them. He loved watching us swim, and he even enjoyed watching all the other families' kids swim too. And for me, I wasn't aiming for first place or second place. I only cared about getting third place, because in my club we had these incredibly fast swimmers who later became Olympic gold medalists. Beating them was basically impossible. So third place was my \"gold medal,\" and the medal was the same size anyway — just a different color.\n\nSo my dad made it fun. Before my races, he would look at the heat sheet and say, \"Okay, you're seeded fourth. These three guys are faster, but this one right here is the one you probably have the best chance of beating. If you can get him, you'll get your third place.\" It was like our little father–son strategy session. He wasn't pushing me — he was just helping me reach the goal I actually cared about. And it made the whole experience really fun for both of us.\n\nAnd after every swim meet, we could pick anywhere we wanted to eat out. That was a big deal for us because we weren't normally allowed to eat junk food. And almost every time, we chose Burger King. For us as kids, getting a Whopper and a vanilla shake — no questions asked — felt like the greatest reward in the world."

And he said, \"If you're planning to major in engineering, where are you going to find an extra five hours every day?\" A lot of Division I swimmers aren't engineering majors, and the few who are basically have no free time. He just didn't see how it was physically possible.\n\nHonestly, I didn't mind. I loved swimming, but I could also see the difference in ability between me and the guys who were going to Senior Nationals — the \"big-boy nationals.\" They had a different level of talent and potential. I knew I could be an average college swimmer, maybe solid, but there was no way I'd ever break into the top eight nationally or do anything at that level.

Confidence that she was alive — truly alive — in Christ.\n\nThere are all kinds of reasons to believe in Jesus — intellectual reasons, emotional reasons, historical reasons. But there are also real experiences that God gives us. And this was mine. It was undeniable. And it confirmed everything the Bible teaches about life, death, and resurrection.\n\nThat's my story."
