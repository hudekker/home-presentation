# **1. Dallas Roots & Family**

**Slide bullets:**

* Born and raised in Dallas
* Middle of three brothers
* Stable, hardworking parents
* Strong family foundation

**Full speaking text:**
So, I’m from Dallas, Texas. I grew up in a pretty typical American family — nothing fancy, just a normal, stable home with two brothers. I’m the middle one: my older brother is two years older than me, and my younger brother is three years younger. My mom and dad have both passed away now, but when we were growing up, they worked really hard to give us a good foundation.

---

# **2. My Mom’s Values & Education**

**Slide bullets:**

* Mom instilled strong values
* Focus on doing right and treating people well
* Her career taught her the value of education
* Education = protection from being “boxed in”

**Full speaking text:**
My mom stayed home with us when we were young, and she was very focused on making sure we had the right values — staying out of trouble, doing the right thing, treating people well. She was also really big on education. Before she got married, she worked as a medical technologist, which is just one step below being a nurse. She realized something important back then: even though she did almost the same job as a nurse, she got paid about half as much. That really stuck with her. It taught her that, like it or not, *the world rewards higher education*, and if you don’t have the degrees, you get boxed in. So she pushed all three of us boys to finish school, go to college, and get our degrees.

# **3. Three Brothers, Three Master’s Degrees**

**Slide bullets:**

* All three sons earned master’s degrees
* My two graduate degrees
* Family strong in technology
* All attended University of Texas

**Full speaking text:**
And we actually did — all three of us have master’s degrees. I ended up with two: a master’s in engineering and an MBA. And all three of us ended up in technology, and we all went to the University of Texas for engineering for our undergrad.

---

# **4. My Dad & Family Dinnertime**

**Slide bullets:**

* Dad focused on time and relationships
* Family dinners every night
* Warm, relaxed conversations
* Deep bonding as a family

**Full speaking text:**
My dad, on the other hand, was all about spending time with us. He worked hard, but he always made time, especially on weekends and we always ate dinner together as one family together. And one of my favorite memories is our family dinnertime. We always had dinner together, and it was fun — we’d talk about what happened during the day, school stories, whatever crazy things happened at practice. It was just a warm, relaxed time together.

---

# **5. From Gymnastics to a Big Decision**

**Slide bullets:**

* Began childhood in gymnastics
* Saw many injuries at camp
* Dad reevaluated the sport
* Transitioned into swimming

**Full speaking text:**
My dad also encouraged us to get involved in sports. When we were young, we started out in gymnastics. We actually did that for a while until we went to this gymnastics camp. The camp was run by professional and collegiate gymnastics athletes — and every single one of them had injuries. I mean, serious injuries. And after seeing that, my dad was like, “Okay, maybe this isn’t the greatest sport for the long run.” So we stepped away from gymnastics and got into swimming.

---

# **6. Swimming, Training, and Dinnertime**

**Slide bullets:**

* Swimming became central
* Two practices a day
* Dad loved hearing about our progress
* No pressure — just support
* Dinnertime became our favorite family time

**Full speaking text:**
**Swimming became a big part of our lives. As we got older, we were training twice a day — we’d swim in the morning before school and then again in the afternoon before dinner. And that made dinnertime even more fun because my dad always wanted to hear how practice went. He never pressured us, never pushed us to win or anything like that — he just genuinely enjoyed hearing what we were doing and how we were progressing. Those conversations were some of my favorite memories growing up.**

---

# **6A. Swim Meets, Third Place Strategy & Burger King Tradition**

**Slide bullets:**

* Dad genuinely loved swim meets
* I always aimed for third place
* Dad helped me strategize
* Fun father–son bonding
* Post-meet treat: Burger King Whopper + vanilla shake

**Full speaking text:**
**And the funny thing is, my dad genuinely loved swim meets. A lot of parents find swim meets boring — you sit for hours for a few minutes of actual racing — but he absolutely loved them. He loved watching us swim, and he even enjoyed watching all the other families’ kids swim too. And for me, I wasn’t aiming for first place or second place. I only cared about getting third place, because in my club we had these incredibly fast swimmers who later became Olympic gold medalists. Beating them was basically impossible. So third place was my “gold medal,” and the medal was the same size anyway — just a different color.**

**So my dad made it fun. Before my races, he would look at the heat sheet and say, “Okay, you’re seeded fourth. These three guys are faster, but this one right here is the one you probably have the best chance of beating. If you can get him, you’ll get your third place.” It was like our little father–son strategy session. He wasn’t pushing me — he was just helping me reach the goal I actually cared about. And it made the whole experience really fun for both of us.**

**And after every swim meet, we could pick anywhere we wanted to eat out. That was a big deal for us because we weren’t normally allowed to eat junk food. And almost every time, we chose Burger King. For us as kids, getting a Whopper and a vanilla shake — no questions asked — felt like the greatest reward in the world.**


---

# **7. High School & Junior Nationals**

**Slide bullets:**

* Swimming became serious
* All three qualified for Junior Nationals
* Top 24 in the nation
* Major milestone and honor

**Full speaking text:**
When we got into high school, swimming became a really serious part of our lives. All three of us ended up qualifying for Junior Nationals, which is the national championship meet for swimmers under 18. To qualify you need to be among the fastest 24 swimmers in the country for an 18 and under athlete and that’s a big deal in the swimming world, and it was a real honor to be able to compete there.

---

# **8. Training with Olympians**

**Slide bullets:**

* Trained with elite swimmers
* Two teammates became Olympic champions
* Didn’t realize their future success
* Incredible hindsight experience

**Full speaking text:**
I also happened to train in high school with two guys who eventually became Olympic gold medalists. Of course, at the time, none of us knew that — we were just three teenagers swimming in the same lanes every day. But looking back, it’s pretty incredible that I was training side-by-side with future Olympic champions.

---

# **9. College Swimming vs Engineering**

**Slide bullets:**

* Dad researched engineering + swimming
* Training load too heavy for engineering major
* Realistic evaluation of swimming potential
* Peacefully stepped away from competition

**Full speaking text:**
Right around the time we were getting ready for college, something changed. All the way through high school, my dad had been our biggest fan — cheering us on, supporting us, encouraging us to have fun with swimming. But when college came around, he actually discouraged us from continuing. He did some research and found that college swimmers, especially at competitive programs, train about five hours a day. And he said, “If you’re planning to major in engineering, where are you going to find an extra five hours every day?” A lot of Division I swimmers aren’t engineering majors, and the few who are basically have no free time. He just didn’t see how it was physically possible.

Honestly, I didn’t mind. I loved swimming, but I could also see the difference in ability between me and the guys who were going to Senior Nationals — the “big-boy nationals.” They had a different level of talent and potential. I knew I could be an average college swimmer, maybe solid, but there was no way I’d ever break into the top eight nationally or do anything at that level. So I was fine stepping away from competitive swimming at that point.

# **10. University of Texas → California**

**Slide bullets:**

* Studied engineering at UT
* Moved to California after graduation
* Worked in high-tech
* Earned master’s degree in LA

**Full speaking text:**
I went to the University of Texas and had a great time there. After graduating, I took a job in California and worked on my master’s degree out there — still in high-tech. I lived in Los Angeles for a while, and I loved it; it was a really fun time in my life.

---

# **11. MBA + CPA & Career Shift**

**Slide bullets:**

* Pursued business and accounting
* Earned MBA and CPA
* Rare engineering + accounting combo
* Shaped future career path

**Full speaking text:**
Later on, I decided I wanted to go deeper into business, so I got an MBA and also became a CPA. That combination — engineering plus accounting — is pretty rare, and it ended up shaping my career. I eventually started my own technology consulting company where I designed and implemented ERP systems — enterprise resource planning systems.

---

# **12. Two Consultants in One**

**Slide bullets:**

* Usually two consultants needed
* I handled both business + technical sides
* Faster projects, clearer communication
* Clients benefited from combined skillset

**Full speaking text:**
Normally in those projects, companies hire two people to work as pairs: a business consultant and a technical consultant together. The business consultant understands accounting and business requirements, and the technical consultant does the programming. I could do both so they got 2 for the price of 1 but actually I still charged the double rate! But the benefit for the customer is time and quality. Nothing got lost in translation, and projects went twice as fast because they only had to work with one person. And when I was inside the code, I could see possibilities that business people needed but didn’t know how to articulate, and I could proactively recommend solutions. That became my specialty because that is not something a technical consultant would recognize or be able to bring back to the business customer.

# **13. Exploring Asia**

**Slide bullets:**

* Traveled China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan
* Looking for a place to live overseas
* Taiwan felt surprisingly natural
* Minimal culture shock

**Full speaking text:**
After running my company for a serveral years, I decided I wanted to explore life overseas. I did a lot of research and traveled around the region — I went to China, Korea, Japan, and finally Taiwan. Out of all those places, Taiwan was where I felt the most comfortable. There was almost no culture shock for me here. Compared to the U.S., I felt surprisingly at home, which definitely wasn’t the case in China, Japan, or Korea. Those places have big cultural gaps, but Taiwan just felt easy and natural.

---

# **14. Why Taiwan Worked**

**Slide bullets:**

* Clear path to permanent residency
* Stable long-term environment
* Other countries restrictive
* Taiwan offered lifestyle + future

**Full speaking text:**
Another major factor was residency. In Taiwan, there’s a clear path to permanent residency, and that’s something I felt was important. I didn’t want to be doing endless visa runs or living somewhere with no long-term option. China doesn’t offer permanent residency. Korea makes it extremely difficult. Japan technically allows it, but it’s also very difficult. Taiwan was the only place with both a good lifestyle fit and a realistic path to staying long-term.

---

# **15. Ten Years in Taipei**

**Slide bullets:**

* Studied Chinese at NTNU
* Earned a degree
* Taught English (TOEFL & adults)
* Not stable long-term due to online shift

**Full speaking text:**
I originally lived in Taipei for about ten years. I studied Chinese at NTNU and earned a degree there. During that time, I also worked for a while as an English teacher. That’s harder than it looks. I taught high school and college students as well as yonng adults. It was fun but I mostly taught TOEFL which had a lot of examp prep for the students and there was not a lot of space in the teaching for fun stuff. However, I also taught English at NTNU which was a little more wide open. But even before COVID, the demand for in-person teaching was already shrinking because so much was moving online. I realized it wasn’t a stable long-term direction, especially since I needed a total of five years of work in Taiwan to qualify for residency.

---

# **16. Starting an Investment Company**

**Slide bullets:**

* Needed 5 years of Taiwan work history
* Taught full-time 1.5 years
* Ran an investment company 3.5 years
* Closed company after residency requirement met

**Full speaking text:**
So I started a business here — an investment company — and I ran that for about three and a half years. Before that, I taught full-time for a year and a half. That gave me the full five years of work experience I needed. Eventually I didn’t need the company anymore, so I closed it.

---

# **17. Moving to Tainan**

**Slide bullets:**

* Lower cost of living
* Housing affordable
* Bought and remodeled a home
* Life pace easier

**Full speaking text:**
After that, I decided to move to Tainan. Life here is much easier and the cost of living is noticeably lower. One of the biggest reasons was housing — buying a house in Taipei wasn’t realistic, but in Tainan it was possible. And I’ve really enjoyed living here. I bought this house and remodeled it pretty much exactly the way I wanted. There are still small things left to fix, but the big work is done.

---

# **18. Renovation Lessons**

**Slide bullets:**

* Learned Taiwan construction culture
* Must watch workers closely
* Avoid corner-cutting
* Redid some work twice

**Full speaking text:**
I learned a lot during that process. In Taiwan, if you’re not watching the workers closely, they’ll cut corners, and then you end up having to hire someone else to come in and fix things. So I had to redo some parts twice, but now I understand the whole process much better. It wasn’t easy, but it was a good learning experience, and I’m really happy with how everything turned out.

---

# **19. Childhood Faith**

**Slide bullets:**

* Grew up in Sunday school
* Positive church environment
* Accepted Jesus around age 10
* Faith felt natural

**Full speaking text:**
Now you might be interested in my Christian experience, so here goes with that.

When I was a kid, my whole family went to Sunday school. All of us boys went, and I actually really liked it. We had a good church, good teachers, and it was just a positive environment. I accepted Jesus as my Savior when I was pretty young — maybe around ten years old — sometime in late elementary school or early middle school.

---

# **20. “Why Doesn’t Everyone Believe?”**

**Slide bullets:**

* Faith felt obvious as a child
* Jesus’ love felt natural
* Shocked when others didn’t believe
* Eye-opening realization

**Full speaking text:**
For me, it felt completely natural. I didn’t struggle with it at all. It was obvious to me that Jesus loved us, the Bible was true, and following Him was the right thing to do. I honestly didn’t understand why everyone didn’t feel the same way. It seemed so clear to me: why wouldn’t everybody want to be a Christian? Why wouldn’t everyone love Jesus?

---

# **21. Growing Up & Seeing Different Beliefs**

**Slide bullets:**

* Bigger schools = more diversity
* Realized many weren’t Christian
* Confusing and surprising
* Continued faith through high school and college

**Full speaking text:**
But later, when I moved on to bigger schools after elementary — schools with more students and older kids — I started noticing something that surprised me. A lot of people weren’t Christians at all. And that really shocked me. I would think, “Why? Why don’t you love Jesus? Why don’t you believe the Bible?” It was genuinely confusing for me. It was a real eye-opening moment, realizing that as people get older, not everyone believes the same way or grows up with the same background.

I stayed involved in church all through high school. When I went to college, I still went, but only about half the time. The same was true after college when I moved to California — I went to church maybe half the time there too. But when I eventually moved back to Dallas, I found a church that I really loved.

---

# **22. Pastor Who Changed My View of Scripture**

**Slide bullets:**

* Pastor spoke naturally
* Down-to-earth teaching style
* Scripture made accessible
* Realized Bible is for everyone

**Full speaking text:**
I loved that church because the pastor was just a normal guy. He wasn’t a “preacher voice” kind of pastor. Even though it was a big church, he talked in a very natural tone, like he was just having a one-on-one conversation with you at Starbucks over a cup of coffee. His style clicked with me.

And it was the first time a pastor ever said something that really changed how I saw my faith. He said, “We’re going to go through the Bible together. But you don’t have to wait for me — you can read this on your own. The Bible was written so normal people could understand it.” That struck me, because before that, I had always thought of the Bible as something you learn from a pastor. But he made me realize that you can actually read it yourself and figure things out directly. That made so much sense to me, and I really appreciated that church because of it.

---

# **23. Evangelism Training**

**Slide bullets:**

* Joined 12-week training
* Learned to share the gospel
* Training + practical outreach
* Required two prayer partners

**Full speaking text:**
Later on, at that same church, I joined a program called evangelism training. It was a long program — maybe around twelve weeks — and I think we met twice a week. The first meeting each week was training for two or three hours. Then later in the week, we’d actually go out and talk to real people, but not right away. We didn’t start doing that until maybe week six. They made sure we were well-trained before sending us out.

I’m going to talk about the next part — the story about my mom and dad — in the next section.

---

# **24. Holy Spirit Leads Me to My Parents**

**Slide bullets:**

* Needed two prayer partners
* Many friends available
* Strong prompting from Holy Spirit
* Hesitated but obeyed

**Full speaking text:**
When I was in that evangelism training program, it turned out to be one of the most interesting and meaningful experiences I’d ever had. Like I said, it was about twelve weeks long, and one of the requirements was that each person needed two prayer partners. I had plenty of friends at church I could’ve asked — that part should’ve been easy. But the Holy Spirit wouldn’t leave me alone. He kept pressing on my heart, very heavily, that I needed to ask *my mom and dad* to be my prayer partners.

I didn’t want to do it. It felt awkward and weird. I kept resisting, but the Holy Spirit just kept pushing and pushing until finally I said, “Okay, fine — I’ll do it.”

---

# **25. My Parents Agree to Join**

**Slide bullets:**

* Dad hesitated at first
* Mom was open
* Began weekly Bible study
* Used a booklet I already knew well

**Full speaking text:**
So I asked them. And to my surprise, my dad didn’t immediately say yes. I expected he would, but instead he said, “I don’t know. Let me think about it.” My mom was the one who responded more openly. Every Sunday after church I would go to their house in Dallas and have lunch with them — that was our routine — and after I asked them, my mom said, “Well, why don’t we do it? Maybe we’ll learn something.” After she said that, my dad agreed too: “Okay. All right.”

So we began. And I suggested using a small Bible study booklet that I had really enjoyed that we just finished with my church bible study group so I was very familiar with it. I said, “Let’s just go through one chapter a week. If we don’t finish the whole chapter in one week, that’s fine — we’ll just meet for about an hour and go at an easy pace.” They agreed.

So we started meeting. We would read Scripture together, I would guide the discussion, and at the end we would pray together. Surprisingly, my mom was more eager to pray out loud than my dad. My dad didn’t really pray out loud — he would pray silently, and I told him that was fine.

---

# **26. Discovering My Dad’s Unbelief**

**Slide bullets:**

* Dad had drifted from faith
* Had his own ideas
* Mom unsure, in the middle
* Important spiritual conversations

**Full speaking text:**
But it didn’t take long before I realized something I never expected: **my dad didn’t believe in the Bible anymore**. I was stunned. I had grown up assuming he still believed. I had no idea that he had drifted away from faith. And when I asked him about it, he said he had developed his own ideas and theories.

My mom was sort of in the middle. She had grown up Catholic, so she had strong training, but she wasn’t sure what to believe anymore. My dad definitely didn’t believe in the gospel — he didn’t believe that salvation had to come through Jesus, or that Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross was necessary. He believed you could just pray directly to God and be forgiven. My mom wasn’t sure — but she was thinking about it.

---

# **27. “Absorbing the Cost”**

**Slide bullets:**

* Sin has a cost
* Someone must absorb it
* “Absorb” is relational
* Example from badminton club

**Full speaking text:**
One thing that helped her was the idea that sin has a cost, and somebody has to absorb that cost. She said that made sense. The accounts don’t balance unless someone pays. I actually like using the expression “absorb the cost” rather than “pay the cost.” “Pay the cost” sounds cold — too accounting-based. “Absorb the cost” sounds relational. It sounds like something you do out of kindness or love.

Like in my badminton club — when the price of shuttlecocks increased, I didn’t say, “I paid the cost.” That sounds mechanical. Instead, I say, “I absorbed the cost,” meaning I paid the difference for the sake of my friends. I absorbed it out of choice, free will, consideration, and kindness. And that’s a picture of what Jesus did — He absorbed the cost for us.

---

# **28. The Question of Salvation**

**Slide bullets:**

* Study booklet led to key question
* “Do you trust Jesus as Savior?”
* Dad said no
* Mom surprisingly said yes

**Full speaking text:**
Anyway, back to the story. We eventually reached the part in the Bible study booklet where it asked the question:
**“Have you come to the point where you trust Jesus to be your Savior?”**

I knew my dad wouldn’t. But I wasn’t sure about my mom. And then, before I even said anything, my mom spoke up and said, “I want to do it.”

I was taken by surprise. I got a little nervous because I wanted to make sure I guided her properly — that I said the prayer the right way. But we prayed together, and she accepted Christ.

But the story doesn’t end there. There’s another part, which I’ll talk about in the next section.

---

# **29. My Mom’s Illness**

**Slide bullets:**

* Two years after accepting Christ
* Became seriously ill
* Passed away within a month
* Very traumatic time

**Full speaking text:**
What’s really amazing is that my mom accepted Christ not long before the end of her life. It’s almost hard to believe, but about two years after she prayed that prayer, she became very sick. She went in and out of the hospital, and then within about a month of getting seriously ill, she passed away.

It was a traumatic time. I remember my dad calling me and saying, “You need to come to the hospital. Your mom died.” He was completely torn up. When I arrived, the nurse took me aside and said, “Your mom is in this room. You can stay with her as long as you want.”

---

# **30. Alone in the Hospital Room**

**Slide bullets:**

* Entered room alone
* Began praying
* Unexpected encounter
* A voice filled my whole body

**Full speaking text:**
So I went into the room. It was just me and my mom’s body lying there on the table. I started to pray. And then something happened that I will never forget for the rest of my life.

I heard a voice.

It wasn’t an audible voice coming through the air — it was more like something that filled me from my head to my toes. A presence that resonated through my entire body. And it was clearer than anything I’ve ever heard, clearer than any speaker or sound system.

---

# **31. “Why Are You Seeking the Living Among the Dead?”**

**Slide bullets:**

* Heard clear internal voice
* Message repeated
* “She is risen”
* “Her work is done here”

**Full speaking text:**
And the voice said:

**“Why are you seeking the living among the dead?”**

I looked at my mom’s body, trying to understand. And the voice repeated:

**“Why are you seeking the living among the dead? She is risen. She is risen just as Jesus promised.”**

I was stunned. Completely stunned. It was unmistakably real. I felt it physically. I heard it internally. I knew it wasn’t my imagination.

And then, as I looked at her body one more time, I heard the voice again:

**“Her work is done here. She is risen.”**

Those were the exact words I heard.

---

# **32. Connecting It to Luke 24**

**Slide bullets:**

* Immediately recalled Luke 24:5
* Same message the angels spoke
* Verse became deeply personal
* Shared with family afterward

**Full speaking text:**
When I heard that voice in the hospital — *“Why are you seeking the living among the dead?”* — it instantly brought me back to a passage I had known since childhood. In the Easter story from Luke 24:5, when the women came to Jesus’ tomb, the angels said, *“Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.”* I had heard that verse countless times growing up, but when those words became connected to my mom’s own passing, and to the reality of her resurrection life with Christ, that verse became even more beautiful and meaningful to me than ever before.

Later, I shared what happened with my dad and my brothers. They listened and said, “Okay, that’s cool,” but I’m not sure whether they really believed it. But for me, it was absolutely real.

---

# **33. Grieving with Hope**

**Slide bullets:**

* Experienced peace instead of despair
* Confidence she is alive in Christ
* Personal confirmation of faith
* My story of God’s reality

**Full speaking text:**
And through the whole funeral and grieving process, I realized something: **I grieved differently.** Instead of being crushed, I felt joy for my mom. Peace. Relief. Confidence that she was alive — truly alive — in Christ.

There are all kinds of reasons to believe in Jesus — intellectual reasons, emotional reasons, historical reasons. But there are also real experiences that God gives us. And this was mine. It was undeniable. And it confirmed everything the Bible teaches about life, death, and resurrection.

That’s my story.
